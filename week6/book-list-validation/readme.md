Continue the Book list example that we discussed at the course, and add following functionalities:
- validate that the title and author fields have values before adding a new book

- display errors, which indicates which field is not completed

- validate duplicate items, if the book already exist in the list display an error

- remove the errors, after the input has value or changed (hint: use "keypress" event listener on inputs)

- reset the form after adding an item

- feel free to rethink the UI of the book list
